abstract: "
In this paper, we study a relation between digits of $p$-adic numbers and Mahler's classification.
We show that an irrational $p$-adic number whose digits are automatic, primitive morphic, or Sturmian is an $S$-, $T$-, or $U_1$-number in the sense of Mahler's classification.
Furthermore, we give an algebraic independence criterion for $p$-adic numbers whose digits are Sturmian."
