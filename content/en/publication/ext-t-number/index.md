abstract: "
As an analogue of Mahlerâ€™s classification for real numbers, Bundschuh introduced a classification for Laurent series over a finite field, divided into $A,S,T,U$-numbers.
It is known that each of the sets of $A,S,U$-numbers is nonempty.
On the other hand, the existence of $T$-numbers has been an open problem.
In this paper, we prove that they exist.
