abstract: "
In this paper, we study the properties of Diophantine exponents $w_n$ and $w_n^{∗}$ for Laurent series over a finite field.
We prove that for an integer $n \\geq 1$ and a rational number $w>2n-1$, there exist a strictly increasing sequence of  positive integers $(k_j)_{j \\geq 1}$ and a sequence of algebraic Laurent series $(\\xi _j)_j$ such that $\\deg \\xi _j =p^{k_j}+1$ and
$$
w_1(\\xi _j)=w_1 ^{∗}(\\xi _j)=\\ldots =w_n(\\xi _j)=w_n ^{∗}(\\xi _j)=w
$$
for any $j \\geq 1$.
For each $n \\geq 2$, we give explicit examples of Laurent series $\\xi $ for which $w_n(\\xi )$ and $w_n^{∗}(\\xi )$ are different.
