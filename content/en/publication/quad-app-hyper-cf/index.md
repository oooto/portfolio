abstract: "
We study quadratic approximations for two families of hyperquadratic continued fractions in the field of Laurent series over a finite field.
As the first application, we give the answer to a question of the second author concerning Diophantine exponents for algebraic Laurent series.
As the second application, we determine the degrees of these families in particular case.
