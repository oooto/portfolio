abstract: "
We establish a new transcendence criterion of $p$-adic continued fractions which are called Ruban continued fractions.
By this result, we give explicit transcendental Ruban continued fractions with bounded $p$-adic absolute value of partial quotients.
This is $p$-adic analogy of Baker’s result.
We also prove that $p$-adic analogy of Lagrange theorem for Ruban continued fractions is not true.
